# README
This repo contains an AndroidX mobile application that can run on Android version 6.0 and above.
It makes use of the webservice: openweathermap (https://openweathermap.org/api). Openweathermap API outputs information about the weather in a dutch city in JSON-format.
In short, the app shows a list of literally all dutch cities with it's corresponding weather data.
# The dependencies
- Volley 1.2.0
- GSON 2.8.6
# Learned
By creating this app I learned creating fragments that changes based on the orientation of the mobile phone (or emulator).
The life-cycle of the activity, persistent data sharing with internal storage and saved instances, and to use async tasks for non-blocking UI.
Last but not least, it covers all the bare basics that a Android mobile developer must know.
The next step is to dive into Android Jetpack suite of libraries.
