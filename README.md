# README
This repo contains an AndroidX mobile application that can run on Android version 6.0 and above.
It makes use of the webservice: openweathermap (https://openweathermap.org/api). Openweathermap API outputs information about the weather in a dutch city in a JSON-format.
In short, the app shows a list of all dutch cities with it's corresponding weather data.
# The dependencies
- Volley 1.2.0
- GSON 2.8.6
# Learned
By creating this app I learned to use fragments that changes based on the current orientation of the mobile phone (or emulator).
The life-cycle of the activity, persistent data sharing with internal storage and saved instances, and it shows the use of async tasks for non-blocking UI.
Last but not least, the app covers all the bare basics that is requested from a Android mobile developer.
The next step is to dive into Android Jetpack suite of libraries.
